# Learning go with tests

[Reference URL](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/iteration)

## Run tests

~~The package should be named as `SOMETHING_test`~~. Just ignore that

- `go test -v ./folder`

## Modules

- Hello world
- Integers
- Iteration
- Arrays and Slices

## Quick Notes (bc i have short memory ðŸ™ƒ)

- `t.Helper()` is used in helper test functions so that if the test fails
  the line number reported will be in our function call rather than inside
  our test helper.
- `slices` package includes the `Equal` method already.
- `func x(numbers ...[]int)` is called a _Variadic Function_ and represents a scenario
  when you can pass _n_ number of parameters of the same type
